## Predicting Seattle AirBnb Ratings
Using Kaggle to collect Seattle AirBnB data I will analyze host ratings based on their property details and their relationship with their customers.

### Installation
Install the files into a folder on your computer
Download Jupyter Notebook to open the files

### Project Motivation
To determine
- whether an AirBnB host can set their prices based on the time of the year
- which variables are closely correlated
- whether the over host rating can be predicted based on the variables provided
